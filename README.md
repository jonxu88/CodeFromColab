# TensorFlowClassification2VGG16.ipynb
Implementation of the VGG16 network (from scratch) to be trained on the CIFAR10 dataset. Accuracy= 0.81 (compared to 0.68 on a basic Convnet).

# JonModifiedTensorFlowTutorialBasicClassification.ipynb
In order to learn the implementation of a convolutional network, I added some convolutional layers
to the Basic Classification Exercise given in the keras tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification
As well, some hyperparemeters were altered to see how they affected accuracy.

# TensorFlowClassification2
