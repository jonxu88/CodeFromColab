#In order to learn the implementation of a convolutional network, I added some convolutional layers
#to the Basic Classification Exercise given in the keras tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification
#As well, some hyperparemeters were altered to see how they affected accuracy.
